# Modbus RTU with ESP32-P4

Modbus RTU with Waveshare ESP32-P4 high performance development board and RS485 HAT for Raspberry Pi. This RS485 HAT fits perfect on the ESP32-P4 board. Up to 3 HATs can be used at the same time. In this program we control a Waveshare Modbus RTU relay board by setting the corresponding coil registers.
